# Looney Tunes Chase A* Algorithm Game

This game involves you controlling Bugs Bunny, and the objective is to burrow through the first two floors and reach the Carrot object on floor 1 without being caught by Yosemite Sam. 

For the best gaming experience, please use the 'Move With' option while playing.

Yosemite Sam tracks Bugs Bunny's location using an A* Pathfinding Algorithm so I have slowed him down to only move every 3 steps you take in order to make the game more playable (otherwise it's quite difficult).
